Highest task completed: 6 (all tasks completed)

NOTE(s):
1- I have used a minecraft diamond ore 256x256 texture for the ground plane
downloaded as a .png from here https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149040 and
converted to .jpg with https://png2jpg.com/
2- I added an ability to 'fly' in the y direction (primarily used for debugging)
with the 'u' and 'y' keys
3- The frustum is drawn with the same material values as the sun to hopefully
be easier to see in the mini map
4- compiler warnings are generated from the stb_image.h file which was copied
directly from lab 8
