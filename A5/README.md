Highest task completed: 6 (all tasks completed) + Window resizing

NOTE(s):
1- I started with A4, so movement is WASD + mouse + uy (up / down)
2- Surface of revolution calculations are done in the GPU (see vase_vert.glsl)
3- Rendering passes can be tested uncommenting lines 70-73 in Pass2_frag.glsl
4- Compile warnings are generated from the lab starter code (stb_image.h)
